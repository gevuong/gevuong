## Hello 🌎

I'm George, a full stack engineer from the San Francisco Bay Area. 

I have 4 years of professional experience, and was formerly [@northwesternmutual](https://github.com/northwesternmutual) building internal web tools with Node, React, and GraphQL to fetch insurance policy data in real-time from various data sources (ie. IBM DB2, AWS RDS), and a PII data masking application in Golang.

## Things I'm Working On 🧑🏻‍💻

- 😷 Updating and fixing bugs on [Virufy](https://www.virufy.org/).
- 🛒 Building an E-commerce web application with React, Redux, TypeScript, Firebase, and Stripe.
- ✍🏻 Continuously documenting things I learn as a developer with Docusaurus.
- 🧐 From time to time, problem solving on LeetCode, Designgurus, and NeetCode.
