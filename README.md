## Hello üåé

I'm George, a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and am actively looking for work.

I have 4+ years of professional experience and was formerly at:
- Tigo Energy, a mid-size renewable energy company, modernizing the tech stack for their flagship software product, [Energy Intelligence (EI)](https://www.tigoenergy.com/monitoring), designing and implementing new classes and schemas for their auditing tool using **PHP** and **SQL**, and writing scripts to migrate data from **Postgres** to [**Clickhouse**](https://clickhouse.com/), which has shown to improve query performance by up to 10x.
- [@northwesternmutual](https://github.com/northwesternmutual), a massive financial services company, building internal web search tools with **NestJS**, **React**, **Typescript**, and **Apollo GraphQL** to fetch insurance policy data in real-time from various data sources (ie. **AWS RDS**, **IBM Db2**), and a PII data masking application in **Golang**.

Although most of my experience has been backend and full-stack, frontend web development is becoming my newfound passion. I find collaborating with UI/UX designers and building professional and engaging user interfaces and experiences to be fun and rewarding.

## Things I'm Working On üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

- Frontend web development [@Virufy](https://virufy.org/en/). I'm transforming new **Figma** designs into responsive web pages on the marketing site, leveraging **React**, **Next.js**, **Typescript**, and **Tailwind CSS** to ensure seamless user experience across devices. The newly designed site is expected to be released by the end of July 2024.
- Actively looking for fullstack, backend, and frontend engineering roles.
