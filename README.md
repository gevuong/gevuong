## Hello üåé

I'm George, a software engineer from the San Francisco Bay Area. 

I have 4+ years of professional experience, and am a self-starter with a passion for continous learning, and staying up-to-date with industry best practices and technologies. My passion lies in leveraging technology to simplify complex processes that result in positive outcomes in people's lives. **Delivering tangible value to customers and colleagues alike gives me a greater sense of fulfillment and purpose in what I'm doing.**

I currently have a strong interest in the aerospace, veterinary, environment and climate tech, and healthcare industries, but am absolutely open to other industries as well.

I was formerly at:
- Tigo Energy as a full stack web developer, modernizing the tech stack for their flagship [Energy Intelligence (EI) software](https://www.tigoenergy.com/monitoring) which would significantly improve user experience and query performance by up to 10x. I primarily used **JavaScript**, **PHP**, **PostgreSQL**, **Clickhouse**, and **Docker**.
- [@northwesternmutual](https://github.com/northwesternmutual) building internal search tools with **Node**, **React**, and **Apollo GraphQL** to fetch insurance policy data in real-time from various data sources (ie. **AWS RDS**, **IBM Db2**), and a PII data masking application in **Golang**.

## Things I'm Working On üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

- Web development lead on the marketing site [@Virufy](https://virufy.org/en/). I'm currently implementing new **Figma** designs for the marketing site. The newly designed website is expected to be released by the end of June 2024. The current tech stack is **Next.js**, **Typescript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
