## Hello 🌎

I'm George, a full stack engineer from the San Francisco Bay Area. 

I have 4+ years of professional experience, and am a self-starter with a passion for continous learning, and staying up-to-date with industry best practices. I was formerly [@northwesternmutual](https://github.com/northwesternmutual) building internal search tools with Node, React, and Apollo GraphQL to fetch insurance policy data in real-time from various data sources (ie. AWS RDS, IBM Db2), and a PII data masking application in Golang.

## Things I'm Working On 🧑🏻‍💻

- 😷 Improving the responsive design, SEO, and overall code quality @Virufy[https://virufy.org/en/].
- 🛒 Learning TailwindCSS by building beautiful, responsive web pages from scratch.
- ✍🏻 Continuously documenting things I learn as a developer with Docusaurus.
- 🧐 From time to time, problem solving on LeetCode, Designgurus, and NeetCode.
